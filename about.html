<p>Hello beautiful people! I am Victoria Fluharty, a twenty-five year old woman trying to find her place in this world of ours. My goal: to become a web developer. How am I going to achieve this? You ask. Well, I am enrolled in the full stack web development bootcamp at Flatiron School! </p>

<p>How about I fill you in on a few basic things you should know about me? I am a runner, baker, and reader. I currently reside in Chicago, IL. I was born and raised in the Los Angeles area of sunny Southern California. I quit my job as an athletic trainer to pursue a career in web development. This is a big and scary step for me. I have a lot to learn, but who doesnâ€™t? So, come join me as I pursue this next step in my life, and all the mistakes and successes I will have along the way. I hope you enjoy the ride.</p>
