My journey to software development has been *unique*, as is everybody’s. I guess the first step to my journey was college, where I got 3 degrees in areas that have NOTHING to do with computer science, software development, or coding in any way, shape, or form. 

I went to college at a small private liberal arts catholic university. There was a computer science degree, but the program was small and actually extinct by my senior year. My freshman year, the school announced that nobody else could enroll in the program and that those in it would be allowed to finish. So, with that said, I never really had the opportunity to enter this profession and honestly, never thought of it. 

When I finished graduate school, I entered the workforce as an athletic trainer. I worked within a few different settings (professional ice hockey, college, and high school). After hitting the big 3 settings for athletic training, I discovered that the profession just wasn’t for me. There were 2 big reasons for this: 

1.  The hours were sporadic and demanding (I worked almost 100 hrs/week at one setting). 
2.  I was having a hard time detaching emotionally after I left work.

So, after deciding to quit my job as an athletic trainer, I took a few months to myself to figure out what to do with my life next. I started a , you know, as all millennials do nowadays to “find myself.” Well, I guess I did! I discovered while creating this blog that I loved the aspect of designing it. Although, I was using a basic website that had default themes, I was absolutely loving it and wishing I could have more control. 

After seeing how much I enjoyed it, my boyfriend suggested I learn HTML and CSS, which I did and I dove deep. I went through multiple tutorials for both HTML and CSS. I then took a plunge into Javascript, which, let me tell you, frustrated me like crazy. 

While learning Javascript, I was scrambling around trying to find tutorials that worked for me. I tried finding websites to practice problems on. I was unsure of where to look and kind of felt lost. I wanted to have some direction and let’s be honest, I am a structured school-loving girl. So, I began my search for bootcamps and I landed here at Flatiron School. 
My journey here was a wild one, but I am happy it happened. I’ve learned that this is the profession for me. It turns one of my biggest personality traits into a positivity thing. I’m a perfectionist, which to some could be a negative trait. To me, now that I’ve found this profession, it is a huge positive. With coding, you can’t mess things up. If you do, you simply have to locate them and fix them. Here, in the coding world, my perfectionist trait is a good thing, and that is what entices me the most and makes my “why?” *unique*.
