For this project, I knew I wanted to incorporate my love for reading in some way. After some contemplation, I decided to create an interactive library for one of my favorite romance authors, Sylvia Day. I decided to scrape her “Books by Sylvia Day” page on [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) in order to collect all of the books she has had published. 
<br>

My goal was to provide the user with the list of all of her published books and have them choose which book they would like to learn more about. At that point, I grabbed that specific book’s page URL and scraped that in order to provide the user with the book’s description. 
<br>

This project was incredibly helpful in having me practice my skills of scraping a website as well as class and object collaborations. The latter was the most difficult part for me when it came to completing the project. I definitely had some frustrating days, not understanding why things weren’t collaborating with one another properly. Luckily, I was able to figure it all out. 
<br>

This project definitely did one great thing for me, **it gave me confidence in regards to debugging my own code**. I was incredibly proud of myself when I fixed an issue on my own that I struggled with for a few days. I had scheduled 2 different project support meetings (one of which we didn’t even get to the topic). I ended up fixing the problem the night before my second meeting!! It was a proud moment. I am thankful for this project for giving me that confidence boost in my own knowledge and capabilities up to this point.
