For this Sinatra project, I decided to create a travel log, which I named TripLogger. This web application allows a user to create an account, login, and logout. It also allows a user to create new trips with city names as well as the duration of their trip. The user has the ability to edit and delete their own trips, as well as view all trips posted by all users. 

This project really helped build my understanding of the `:has_many, through:` relationship. I was having a really hard time wrapping my mind around the topic, not so much in the concept, but how to execute it within a MVC model. Now that the project is over, my understanding of it has strengthened by 1000x. It is a night and day difference, and I am incredibly glad that I decided to pursue a topic I wasn’t so sure how to use, rather than going the simple route. Challenging oneself to gain a better understanding of a confusing topic is always a great idea!

Another big take away from this project for me had to deal with a project support meeting. The coach that I had was amazing and helped guide me to figure out what I was doing wrong rather than just telling me. It helped me gain a better understanding of certain topics. He also didn’t know an exact answer to one of my questions and we spent 10 minutes discussing possible options on how to fix it. The discussion was incredibly helpful. 

I feel like this project helped strengthen by debugging skills, error reading skills, and overall Sinatra code-building skills. It also gave me experience bouncing ideas off of someone and getting that “real-world” experience. Although at times, the project was frustrating, I really enjoyed creating it!
