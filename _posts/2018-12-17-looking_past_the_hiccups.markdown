When I started this project, I thought it would be a piece of cake. I barely had any issues passing all of the labs and felt like I completely understood the lessons within this section. This is the one section that I never had to use “Ask a Question” because everything was clicking for me. I was so excited to get to the project and truly feel confident in my skills. I thought, “yeah, I’ll hit a few snags, but I’m confident that I have the knowledge and tools to figure them out easily.” Well, I’m here to tell you that I was **COMPLETELY WRONG**. 

This project took a temporary huge hit to my coding confidence, meanwhile all of my previous projects have made me feel so much more confident in my skills. I went into the other projects thinking “this is going to be tough but I’ll get through because Flatiron is awesome and I have all of these tools to help me succeed.” Well, this project was the complete opposite, and you know what? Maybe, just maybe, it was the attitude I had going into the project that really played a part in my frustration levels while coding. When you think you understand something and it turns out, you didn’t fully understand it all, it is an awful feeling. 

I wasn't only frustrated with myself during this project, but also with Flatiron. I felt like the help for this project was basically nonexistent. Any time I got stuck, I scheduled a project support meeting or I emailed the sectional lead. After 2 weeks of struggling to get help and one awful project support meeting, I finally got an answer from the sectional lead and scheduled time to discuss my code. Unfortunately that 15 min time block set aside for me wasn’t enough to even fix the issue I was having. It gave me no further insight in to what I was doing wrong and how to go about fixing it. I was told I’d get an email with further resources so that I could figure it out on my own and here we are a month later and guess what? I still haven’t received that email. 

With waiting a week or so in between replies, I tried reaching out to other sectional leads who had helped me in the past and was told to contact the sectional lead I had already been trying to contact. It was a bit frustrating. 

Luckily enough, one of my peers decided to help me out. Or should I say *many* of my peers tried helping me out. **THIS**, this is my one huge takeaways from this project: pair coding, bouncing ideas off of one another, and reaching out to your fellow peers is the best way to get help. 

My friend helped me by just taking peaks at my code every now and then and telling me what to look for when I debugged. She more often than not didn’t give me the answers, she just steered me in the right direction and I appreciate her so much for that. It helped me in more ways than one. 

I also had my first experience posting a question to Stack Overflow during this project. I posted more on the Slack channels asking for help than ever before. My peers helped me so much within this project and I understand topics more clearly now. I also learned that sometimes you just need a fresh pair of eyes to take a look at your code so that a tiny mistake can be found. 

While Flatiron’s technical coaches and sectional leads were little help to me during this project, Flatiron at least creates a safe atmosphere for all of us students to help one another through the Slack channels. 

While my confidence in Javascript was a roller coaster ride during this project, I’m feeling more confident in my debugging and pair coding skills than ever before. 

If there is something that I can truly feel proud of in regards to this project, it is that I never gave up and I never stopped asking for help. I never gave in to the negative thoughts rolling through my head that I shouldn’t be a software engineer, that I didn’t have what it takes. **I stayed strong.** I finished it. I’m one step closer to graduation.
