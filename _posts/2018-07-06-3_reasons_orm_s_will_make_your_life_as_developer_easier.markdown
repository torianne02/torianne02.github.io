Before we dive right into why an ORM will make your life as a developer simpler, let’s answer a few basic questions about ORM’s. 
<br><br>
**First, what is an ORM?** 
<br><br>
An ORM, or object-relational mapping tool, is a technique that allows a programmer to query and manipulate data from a database utilizing an object-oriented programming language. 
<br><br>
**Second, what programming languages can utilize ORM’s?** 
<br><br>
As stated previously, ORM’s work alongside object-oriented programming languages. This includes, but is not limited to, Java, Python, and Ruby. 
<br><br><br>
Now, let us dive into the big question: **how do ORM’s make a web developer’s life easier? **
<br><br>
1. ORM’s help **cut down on overall development time.** This is arguably the most beneficial reason to use an ORM. As a developer, we are always looking for ways to increase our productivity. Although the code that the ORM tool is developing isn’t complex, it still takes up a good portion of your development time, as it would be a lot of tedious work to do manually. It is said that your development time could be cut down anywhere between 20% and 50% dependent upon your situation/project. 

2. ORM’s produce more **effective design patterns.** A great ORM tool is created by a group of experienced software architects. These architects implement effective design patterns that essentially force a programmer to utilize proper programming practices within their project/application. An example of a great programming practice that an ORM forces a programmer to implement is DRY (don’t repeat yourself). This helps keep code clean and effective. Although I’m sure you think you’d produce great effective code, sometimes it’s better to leave it up to the experienced developers. 
<br><br>
A really important point to argue at this moment, would be if there were a team of developers working on one project, everyone’s code would be inconsistent with one another’s, as every developer is different. This could possibly cause a program or application to break. It would be a lot easier and more efficient for a team to use an ORM so that the code design would be more consistent from one team member to another. 

3. ORM’s **reduce testing time.** ORM’s not only cut down on the development time, but also the testing time of a program/application. If you generated your code utilizing an ORM, it is assumed that the code is coming from code templates that were thoroughly tested by the software vendor; as well as being tested thousands of times by other customers who have helped debug and improve the code. With this said, it is still your responsibility as a good programmer to test your code to make sure it is working the way you expect/want it to. Taking that into consideration, the amount of time spent testing, is still greatly decreased. 
<br><br>


With all of this said, there are still some negatives as well as more positives to utilizing an ORM, and as a good practicing developer, I suggest you take a few minutes to educate yourself on some of those before making the decision to utilize an ORM in your design. I personally will be using ORM’s in the future, because I believe the positives outweigh the negatives; however, I can’t make that decision for everyone! All I hope is that I have helped make a good argument for the pros column. 
<br><br>
Happy coding!!
